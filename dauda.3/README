 #  Project details

        My file names are "oss.c" and "user.c". I have a Makefile which when run with the command "make", it 
	compiles my project into an execuatables named oss and user. In addition, 
	it also remove all generated object files when called with "make clean".

        I set up a git as a version control inside my working directory(dauda.3)
        and this is where I added and commited all my updated files. 

        I piped the output of the command "git log" to a file named "gitlog".


        ##  To compile and run this project:

        Step 1: cd into the directory "dauda.3"
        Step 2: type the command "make" and press "enter". 
        Step 3: then type any of the commands below and hit enter to see the different outputs

        ./oss -h

        ./oss -s x -l filename -t z

        where x is the number of process to be spawned,
	      filename is the name of output file,
	      and z is the total running time before termination.


        ###  Problem/comments

        I had issues  with sempahore, signal handling, and with clearing shared memory.
