To compile, use the command: 		make
To run the program, use the command: 	./oss and press enter.
To clean/remove executable files: 	make clean

After running, a statistical output will be printed to the screen and a file named "file.log" will be generated. 
The file.log contains the operational information about the times that resources are requested, released, and allocated.

I used git version control and have the git operation in a file named gitlog.
