To run:

	type: 		make and press enter,
	then type: 	./oss

	an output will be generated in a file called "log".

I also have the output of git log in a file called "gitLog"

Problems:
	1: I used 2 secs for the signal handler and this is not giving the program enough time to run.
	2: I could not complete this project because I was getting below message on the server

			make: vfork: Resource temporarily unavailable
