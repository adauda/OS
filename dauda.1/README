	#  Project details

	My file name is chain.c and I have a Makefile which compiles my project into an execuatable
	called ass1 when called with onle "make". In addition, it also remove all generated object 
        files when called with "make clean".

	I set up a git as a version control inside my working directory(dauda.1)
        and this is where I added and commited all my updated files. 

	I piped the output of the command "git log" to a file named "log".


	##  To compile and run this project:

	Step 1: cd into the directory "dauda.1"
	Step 2: type the command "make" and press "enter". 
	Step 3: then type any of the commands below and hit enter to see the different outputs

	./ass1 -h

	./ass1 -p

	./ass1 -n x

	where x is any number greater than 1.


	###  Problem/comments

	I had a little challenge with following the git set up guidelines givens, but thankfull I was able to figure
	it out from asking question about it in class and looking up how to do it on youtube.
